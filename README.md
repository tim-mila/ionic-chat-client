# Ionic Interviews - Chat Client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tim-mila/ionic-chat-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tim-mila/ionic-chat-client)

This is a simple chat client that needs a backend.

You should implement a simple API as described below, storing `users`, `rooms`, and `chats`.

Each endpoint (except `login` and `signup`) should expect a JWT token supplied in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` method, so the header will look like `Authorization: Bearer TOKEN`. The `login` and `signup` methods should return a JWT token in the `token` field of the JSON response.

## Getting Started

First, fork then clone this repo and run `npm install`:

To test the client, run `npm start`.

### Removing mock/dev mode

By default the app has a mocked-out API. To remove the mocking system, edit `src/api.ts` and set `MOCK = false`.

### Setting API/Web Socket Host

In `src/api.ts` you can adjust the `API_URL` for the Rest API, and `SOCKET_URL` for the web socket server. By default they are set to

`API_URL` - `http://localhost:4000`

`SOCKET_URL` - `localhost:8080`

Feel free to adjust these as you see fit.

## API

The Client expects the following API endpoints that accept/return JSON:

*Note the syntax `{ username, password }` means `{ username: theUsername, password: thePassword }`*:

 * `/api/v1/user/login`
   - `POST` - `{ username, password }` - log a user in
      - Returns `{ username, token }` where `token` is a JWT
 * `/api/v1/user/signup`
   - `POST` - `{ username, password }` - sign a user up
      - Returns `{ username, token }` where `token` is a JWT
 * `/api/v1/rooms`
   - `GET` - returns the list of rooms
      - Returns `[{ name }]` where `name` is the name of the room
 * `/api/v1/room`
   - `POST` - `{ name }` - create a room with name `name`
      - Returns `{ name }`
 * `/api/v1/rooms/:roomName/chats`
   - `GET` - get the chats for this room
      - Returns `[{ at, room, username, text }]` where `at` is an ISO 8601 formatted date string for the creation time, `room` is the name of the room, `username` the username of the user who created the chat, and `text` the content of the chat.
   - `POST` - `{ room, username, text } post a new chat to this room
      - Returns the `[{ at, room, username, text }]` where `at` is an ISO 8601 formatted date string for the creation time, `room` is the name of the room, `username` the username of the user who created the chat, and `text` the content of the chat that was just created. **NOTE** This response is what is broadcast over the websocket connection.
      
## Web Sockets

The client will try to connect to a simple web socket server in order to handle updates across client instances.

The WS path is `ws://SOCKET_URL/chat`

When the client sends a chat, it sends the chat message to the REST API *and* as serialized as JSON to the WS server. The WS server then simply broadcasts the exact message back to all clients. The message that is broadcast is the response JSON from the api `POST` to `/api/v1/rooms/:roomName/chats`

The WS client doesn't send auth information so authentication on the WS server isn't part of the scope.
